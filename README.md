Fibonacci
=========
This is a simple program to calculate the nth fibonacci number using closed-form solution. 

This is the formula I use:
F(n) = sqrt(5)*(((1 + sqrt(5))^n)/2 - ((1 + sqrt(5))^n)/2)

The problem with this solution is that it starts giving me errors in rounding starting with the 72nd number. 
You're welcome to fix it and send me a pull-request!
